# Hearing Conservation

Under the hearing conservation program, your employer is required to:

- Monitor noise levels
- Conduct hearing tests
- Maintain records
- Offer annual training 
- Provide hearing protection

Introduce administrative (work practice) controls.

- Reduce the number of personnel present

- Adjust schedules to reduce exposure time

Require workers to wear personal protective equipment (PPE)

- Your employer will:

- Select and provide the hearing protection for your workplace

- Train you how to use it

- The hearing protection chosen should have a listed Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) sufficient to protect against the noise levels present

- It is YOUR responsibility to wear hearing protection every time you are in an environment with  
    hazardous noise

- Remember to use hearing protection during noisy activities away from work, too

- If the noise level is high enough that you have to raise your voice when speaking with someone 3 feet away, you should be wearing hearing protection

Inspect your hearing protection prior to each use.

- Check earplugs and canal caps for dirt, damage or extreme hardness

- Discard if compromised

- Check pre-molded plugs for deterioration

- Discard if the rubber is cracked or if they no longer form a good seal in the ear canal

- Check earmuffs for cracks and leaks in the earcups or cushions

- Replace damaged cushions

- Discard earcups if damaged

- Discard earmuffs when the headband no longer holds the cups tightly against the ear

Single-use earplugs are designed for daily use. Dispose of them after every use or if they become dirty.

Clean pre-molded earplugs, canal caps and earmuffs after each use.

- Wipe down with mild soap and warm water, and gently pat dry

- Never submerge earmuffs in water

- Do not treat with any other substances

Keep your hearing protection inside a case between uses.

Hearing protectors don’t last forever.

- The type of equipment, environment and manner of use play a role in determining how long protectors last

- Refer to manufacturer instructions for service life recommendations

A short-term (acute) exposure to moderate noise can result in a temporary loss of hearing (Temporary Threshold Shift).

A short, intense sound, such as an explosion, may cause immediate hearing loss, which can be permanent (Acoustic Trauma).

Most hearing loss, however, happens gradually upon exposure to high noise levels over a period of time (Permanent Threshold Shift).
