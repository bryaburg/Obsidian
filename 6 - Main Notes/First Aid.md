# First Aid

Remember, fear of a lawsuit should not prevent you from helping someone in need. In fact, you should help someone to the best of your ability. Now, let’s talk about some more emergency situations.

- Emergencies can happen to anyone, anywhere

- Be prepared to recognize an emergency situation

- Pay attention to your senses of sight, hearing and smell

- Emergencies are often signaled by something unusual that catches your attention

- Several conditions that require immediate attention are an inadequate airway, lack of breathing and excessive loss of blood

- During an emergency situation, you must protect yourself, as well as the victim, from injury

- Survey the scene or surroundings quickly

- Note any hazards to you and the victim

- Is the scene safe?

- Remember: It does no good if you, the rescuer, enter the dangerous environment and become a victim yourself

- After determining that a victim needs help, call the EMS

- Whenever possible, send another person to make the call while you provide care

- Single out one or two bystanders and direct them to call “911” or other designated local emergency number

- Calling for help is often the most important step you can take to help the victim

- Be prepared to tell the EMS:

- Where the victim is

- What happened

- How many persons are sick or injured

- The condition of the victim(s)

- First aid that is being given

- The telephone number that you are calling from

- Do not delay contacting the EMS, even if you don’t know all of this information

- While administering first aid, the primary objectives are to maintain circulation and breathing

- You must respond rapidly, stay calm and think before you act

- Do not waste time looking for first aid supplies; do the best you can with what is at hand

- Send someone else to retrieve first aid supplies

- Call 911 or the local emergency number as soon as possible

- Never move a victim unnecessarily

- The major concern with moving an injured person is making the injury worse

- Do not move a victim with a possible spinal injury unless the accident scene is such that there is imminent danger of further injury or unless it is necessary to establish breathing

- If the victim has possible head, neck or back injuries, try to keep the head straight and in line with the rest of the body

- If you must move an injured person, try to drag him by the clothing around the neck or shoulder area

- If possible, drag the person onto a blanket or large cloth and then drag the blanket

- If an unconscious victim is not breathing, his life is threatened

- Seconds can count:

- Check the scene for safety, then check the victim

- If the victim is unresponsive, call 911 or the local emergency number

The critical initial elements of CPR are chest compression and early defibrillation. The sequence of steps has the acronym C-A-B, or CAB.

- C: Compressions: Give 30 chest compressions (at a rate of 100 per minute) to a depth of 2 inches

- A: Airway: Establish the victim’s airway using a head-tilt, chin-lift. If airway isn’t clear, try to clear it

- B: Breathing: Perform two breaths, using a mouth shield if possible

If you are not certified to perform CPR, it is recommended that you perform only “C” – chest compressions.

Survival rates for victims of sudden cardiac arrest increase dramatically when there is early access to an automated external defibrillator (AED).

- If the victim is conscious and you suspect that she is choking, ask the victim to cough, speak or breathe

- If the victim can do none of these things, you must get the airway open quickly:

- Stand behind the victim and wrap your arms around her waist

- Move your hand across the abdomen to the area above the navel but below the rib cage

- Make a fist and place your thumb side on the stomach

- Place your other hand over your fist and press into the victim’s stomach with quick upward thrusts until the object is dislodged

- If the victim is pregnant or obese, use the following method:

- Wrap your arms around the person’s chest

- Place your fist on the middle of the breastbone, between the nipples

- Make firm, backward thrusts

- As with any choking incident, after the object that caused choking is removed, keep the victim still and get medical help

- All choking victims should have an evaluation by a medical professional as complications from choking can occur as well as from the first aid measures that were used to relieve the choking

If a choking victim is unresponsive when you first encounter him or her, you might not know whether an airway obstruction exists.

Call 911 or your local emergency number, and start CPR using the C-A-B sequence. If you are not CPR-certified, only perform “C” – Chest compressions.

- If respirations do not go in, reposition the head and re-attempt

- If they still do not go in, open the victim’s mouth wide and look for an object

- If you see an object that can easily be removed, remove it with your fingers

- If you do not see the object, continue doing CPR until help arrives

- One of the best ways to treat a major open wound is to place a sterile dressing or clean cloth on the wound and apply pressure with the palm of your hand until the bleeding stops

- Raise the bleeding part higher than the heart, unless that is too painful

- Cover the dressing with a bandage

- Once the bleeding stops, do not try to remove the cloth that is against the open wound as it could disturb the blood clotting and restart the bleeding

Always consult a healthcare provider

- Never use a tourniquet except in response to an extreme emergency, such as a severed arm or leg or severe hemorrhage

- Can damage nerves and blood vessels, lead to tissue death and cause the victim to lose an arm or leg

- Internal bleeding, although not usually visible, can result in serious blood loss

- Victims with internal bleeding can develop shock before you realize the extent of their injuries

- Bleeding from the mouth, ears, nose, rectum or any other body opening is considered serious and normally indicates internal bleeding. Another sign is a hard abdomen

- Call 911 or the local emergency number

- If the injury is extensive, the victim may go into shock and should be treated for it

- Shock usually accompanies severe injury or emotional upset

- Even if the injury doesn’t directly cause death, the victim can go into shock and die

- The signs of shock are:

- Cold and clammy skin, chills

- Confusion

- Frequent nausea or vomiting

- Altered consciousness

- Rapid breathing

Shock cannot be managed by first aid alone. It requires medical treatment, so all you can do is prevent it from getting worse.

- You can maintain an open airway for breathing, control any obvious bleeding and stay with the victim until medical help arrives

- Until emergency help arrives, have the victim lie down

- Make the victim as comfortable as possible

- Control any external bleeding

- Elevate the legs unless it is painful to the victim

- If the victim is cool, cover him with a blanket to prevent chilling or loss of body heat

- Do not give the victim anything to eat or drink, even though he is likely to be thirsty

- When caring for a muscle, bone or joint injury, always check and care for life-threatening conditions first

- Call 911 or the local emergency number if the victim’s head, neck or back is injured or if the victim has any trouble breathing

When caring for a muscle, bone or joint injury, always check and care for life-threatening conditions first

- Do not encourage the victim to move the injured part in order to identify a fracture since such movement could cause further damage to surrounding tissues and promote shock

- Place the injured part in as natural a position as possible without causing discomfort to the victim

- Apply ice to control swelling and help reduce pain

- Most importantly, minimize movement of the injured part until medical personnel arrive

- Be careful not to move the victim in any way that causes pain

- The purpose of splinting is to keep an injured part from moving

- Medical personnel are better equipped to splint and immobilize broken bones

- However, if you must move or transport the victim, you must immobilize the injured part

- Protect the injured part from further injury by applying splints long enough to extend well beyond the joints above and below the fracture

- Use a pressure bandage to control any bleeding, but don’t apply too tightly

- Only splint the injury if you can do so without hurting the victim

- Apply ice and elevate the injured part

- To treat a sprain or strain, elevate the injured part if possible and apply ice to control swelling and help reduce pain

- Never put ice directly on bare skin

- Ice should be applied to the injury periodically for about 48-72 hours or until the swelling goes away

- Most importantly, minimize movement of the injured part

- You do not need to know the exact kind of musculoskeletal injury to provide proper care

- General care guidelines for a fracture, sprain or strain include:

- Making the victim more comfortable

- Placing the injured part in as natural a position as possible without causing discomfort to the victim

- Elevating the injured part

- Applying ice to control swelling and help reduce pain

- Most importantly, minimizing movement of the injured part

Each type of burn can occur in a different way, but treatments for most minor burns are very similar:

- Immerse the burned area immediately in cool water; keep under running water; or apply clean, cool, moist towels

- If the burn is small enough, keep it completely under water

- Do not use ice because it may cause further damage to the burned area

- Maintain this treatment for 15 minutes even if the pain stops

- Avoid breaking any blisters that may appear

- Cover the burn loosely with dry, sterile dressings or a clean cloth

- Reduces pain and prevents infection and further damage

- A critical burn needs immediate medical attention

- Always ensure that the victim is breathing

- If the victim’s clothing is stuck to the burn, don’t try to remove it

- Remove any jewelry, rings and watches, as these may constrict blood flow due to swelling

- If possible, raise burned areas above the level of the heart

- Protect the victim from drafts and keep the victim dry

- Do not scrub the burn and do not apply any soap, ointment or home remedies

- Continue to monitor the victim until EMS personnel arrive

- If the victim was burned by a liquid chemical, call 911 or other designated emergency number immediately

- Flush the burn with water until EMS personnel arrive and take over

- A chemical burn to the eye requires immediate attention

- Flood the eye with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes

- Flush the eye to the outside, from the bridge of the nose to the opposite corner of the eyes

- If the victim still complains of burning in the eyes, continue to flush the eye with large amounts of water until burning subsides or EMS arrives

- Do not patch or cover the eyes

- Administer CPR if necessary

- Once the victim is stable, assess the severity of the burns

- If no open wounds are involved, run cold water over the burns

- Open blisters or wounds should be covered with sterile gauze

- Keep the victim warm and try to maintain a normal body temperature until medical help arrives
