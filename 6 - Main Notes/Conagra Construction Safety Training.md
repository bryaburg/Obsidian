- ## Properties of anhydrous ammonia:
	- Low boiling point (-28F).  Good for refrigeration, but can cause frostbite
	- Very corrosive. Can cause burns to skin, eyes, lungs
	- Hygroscopic; seeks water from the nearest source. Eyes, nose, throat, mouth, moist skin
- Most deaths are the result of damage to the throat and lungs
- ## Symptoms of exposure vary with concentration
	- Low concentration (5-50ppm) - headaches, loss of sense of smell, nausea, vomiting
	- Concentration >50ppm - irritation to nose, mouth, throat; coughing, wheezing
	- High concentration (300-500ppm) - immediately dangerous to life; lung irritation, coughing, shortness of breath
- Ammonia is flammable and explosive, especially if released in a confined space
- Federal and state laws require a plan to prevent accidents and to respond to emergencies

- # Confined Space
- Confined spaces are not designed to be populated yet they can allow a person entry or exit
- Manhole
	- A small confined space, like a manhole, has a narrow opening and is available for a worker to squeeze in and perform their job duty.  Access to space like a manhole is restricted, and the narrow opening means employees should take caution while entering and exiting
- Crawlspace
	- A large confined space, like a crawl space, is large enough for a worker to enter and commonly sufficiently sized to complete the task.  However, it in not designed for regular occupancy
- Tank
	- Workers cannot continuously work in a complete enclosed space.  They may enter and perform a specific duty, and may have difficulty due to space constraints within the area.  Once the worker exits this space, they must barricade it to prevent unauthorized entry.
- Confinement could lead to injury
- Tight entry/exist
- Restricted airflow
- Air quality issues affect confined spaces
	- insufficient oxygen
	- toxic
	- combustible
	- generally harmful atmosphere

	- Contains or has the potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere
	- Contains material that may potentially engulf an entrant
	- Has walls that converge inward or floors that slope downward and taper into a smaller area; thin is an asphyxiation risk
	- Contains any other recognized safety or health hazard, including unguarded machinery, exposed live wires, or heat stress
- Entry permit:
	- Workers must obtain a written permit each time they enter a permit-required confined space.  A copy must be kept at the confined space for the attendant to reference.  On the entry permit, the entry supervisor will write down the exact time allotted for the work.  The entry permit expires immediately upon completion of the work, or when the time allotted expires - whichever comes first.
- Signs
	- Signage will identify a confined space as permit-required
- Tripod Extraction Device
	- Rescue services equipment must be available at every permit-required confined space.  This includes a no-entry retrieval system (such as a harness and cable attached to a mechanical hoist).   tripod extraction device provides safety for the attendant and emergency response team, who will not need to physically enter the space to retrieve the worker inside.
- Rescue Items
	- Respirators, including self-contained breathing apparatuses, must be easily accessible for use by rescue personnel.  This includes all types of respirators and cartridges.
- Monitoring Device
	- Essential for evaluating the safety of the atmosphere, monitoring devices allow for testing of a confined space before and during entry.
- Copy of permit-required confined space entry program
	- This document must be nearby for reference by the attendants and workers
- Attendant
	- Attendants do not enter the confined space.  They are responsible for monitoring the entry, limiting access to unauthorized personnel, protecting the space from outside hazards, and isolating the space from hazards.  Attendants are highly trained in every aspect of the entry program.
- Worker 
	- Workers are specifically authorized to enter a permit-required confined space.  They have received training on the appropriate use, testing, and maintenance of all ventilation, communication, and emergency equipment.  They understand how to properly use protective clothing or gear to ensure the utmost safety upon entry and exit of the space.
- Communication Device
	- Communication between the attendant and worker is essential during every aspect of the job task.  Communication devices may vary; one example is a radio
