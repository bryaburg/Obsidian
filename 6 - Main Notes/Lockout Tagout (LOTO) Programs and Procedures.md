# Tagout (LOTO) Programs and Procedures

Energy powers industrial machines and systems. Many people may hear the word “energy” and think of electricity. However, many other forms of energy are hazardous. Select each form of hazardous energy for a brief description and some examples. See your supervisor or safety professional or review lockout/tagout procedures to learn about forms of hazardous energy where you work.

Electricity powers motors, heaters and other equipment. Machine operation, electrical shocks, arcing and fires are possible if electrical energy isn’t properly controlled.

Moving mechanical parts can be hazardous, especially when cutting, crushing, trapping or snagging occurs.

Hydraulic energy uses controlled circulation of pressurized fluid to power pistons and other devices.

Pneumatic energy, or compressed air, drives air tools and opens pistons and valves. The valves may control chemical energy in piping systems, as well as mechanical energy.

Radiation can be non-ionizing microwaves, radio waves, intense visible light, IR, UV and laser light. Ionizing radiation includes x-rays, alpha, beta 

Thermal energy can burn or freeze skin. Thermal energies include extremely hot or cold surfaces, cryogenic liquids and steam.

Chemicals may be toxic, corrosive, reactive, flammable or explosive. They may be in solid, liquid or gas form.

Energy-Isolating Devices

- Manually operated electrical circuit breaker

- Disconnect switch

- Line valve

- Block

- Blank flange

- Bolted slip blind

- Conductor switch

A tagout device, such as a tag, warns people not to operate equipment or restore power to it.

Use tagout devices in addition to lockout devices. When lockout is not possible, we must still tag out.

Tagout devices must be legible, durable and secure.

Attach tagout devices to (or as close as possible to) the energy-isolating device.

Durable (able to withstand environment/use)

Standardized (consistent in color, shape, size, print and format)

Substantial (able to withstand 50 lbs or 23 kg of force, hard to accidentally remove or miss)

Identifiable (easy to recognize and understand)

Employers use an energy control program to ensure that equipment is de-energized and isolated from its energy sources before people perform service and maintenance.

The program includes information that employees need to know so they may safely perform lockout/tagout.

Programs are written to meet the needs of the workplace and the types of equipment people will maintain or service.

Energy Control Procedures

Energy control procedures within an energy control program may include:

- How to use the procedure
- Steps to shut down, isolate, block and secure equipment
- Steps to place, remove and transfer lockout/tagout devices
- Responsibilities during procedures
- Requirements for testing equipment to verify energy control

Inspection Requirements

At least once per year, employers conduct formal inspections of their energy control procedures to make sure they are effective, and that people are using them appropriately. The inspection may include reviewing procedures and responsibilities with employees to ensure their understanding of the energy control program.  
  
Inspection documentation should include the name of the inspector, the date of the inspection, and the equipment and people included in the inspection. The inspector and responsible people note any defects, correct those defects and document their corrective actions, per their employer's requirements.

Training Requirements

Energy control programs outline training and retraining requirements employees must meet depending on their exposure to equipment, types of energy and hazards.  
  
In addition to refresher training, employees receive training when inspections reveal defects and when assignments, equipment or procedures change.

As you are using the energy control program, you might find a problem.  
Perhaps you find that the procedure is confusing or incorrect.

If you identify a problem, you must stop and get help.

Make sure you or a qualified person address any issues before you proceed.

It's your job to work safely and keep other people safe.

The first step is to notify all affected employees that an authorized employee is about to shut down and lock out the equipment to perform the service or maintenance.

The authorized employee must know the type of energy and how much force it has.

It’s important to remember that there may be more than one energy source in each piece of equipment.

The authorized employee must know the hazards of the energy to be controlled and how to control the energy.

Step 3 is for the authorized employee to shut down the equipment using the procedures in the energy control program.

Doing so helps to avoid exposing employees to hazards that may result from the equipment stopping.

For instance, switches can arc or explode if electrical power is disconnected while equipment is operating.

During this step, the authorized employee must locate the appropriate energy-isolating devices to control the equipment's energy sources.

In step 5, the authorized employee will apply the lockout or tagout devices

Remember that lockout devices hold energy-isolating devices in a "safe" or "off" position.

Tagout devices clearly indicate that people may not operate the equipment or remove lockout/tagout devices.

Attach tagout devices to, or as close as possible to, the locks and energy-isolating devices.

The authorized employee must dissipate all potentially hazardous stored or residual energy in components such as capacitors, springs, elevated machine members, rotating flywheels, hydraulic systems, and air, gas, steam or water pressure.

Some examples of methods of making the energy safe include grounding, repositioning, chocking or bleeding down.

Authorized employees should check the energy control program and procedures for specific steps and guidance.

The final step is for the authorized employee to make sure the equipment is isolated or disconnected and de-energized.

This is sometimes called the verification or try-out step and it is VITAL to the safety and well-being of everyone working on or near the equipment.

Never assume that steps 1 through 6 worked; instead you must VERIFY that they worked using the steps in your employer's energy control program and procedures.

It may be as simple as trying to start up the equipment and verifying that you cannot.

Regardless of the complexity, never skip this step. Only when it is complete may anyone begin service or maintenance work.

Please follow your employer's specific energy control program and procedures when removing lockout/tagout devices.

Only the authorized employee who installed the locks and tags can remove locks and tags.

In rare cases in which the authorized employee is not available/reachable, follow the energy control program guidance to identify a designee to remove the locks and tags and inform the original installer.

The authorized employee must begin the removal process by inspecting the work area to ensure that non-essential items have been removed and that equipment components are intact and capable of operating properly.

This includes restoring interlocks and machine guards that may have been made inoperable during service or maintenance.

Next, the authorized employee will check the area around the equipment to ensure that all employees are a safe distance away.

During step 3, the authorized employee or designee removes the locks and tags.

Finally, the person who removes the locks and tags notifies affected employees immediately after removing the devices and before re-energizing and starting equipment.

- Inspect the work area.
- Keep people away.
- Remove lockout/tagout devices.
- Notify affected people

There are some situations when your energy control program will have unique procedures you must follow.

These may include:

- Energization required for testing

- Outside personnel being on-site

- Shift changes

- Group lockout/tagout procedures

Some servicing or maintenance operations  
may require equipment or components to be energized.

In these cases, the energy control program may require the authorized person to clear the area, remove the devices, test the equipment performance and then, eventually, reapply locks  
and tags using standard procedures.

When outside personnel, such as contractors, are on-site, the employers should inform each other of their respective lockout or tagout procedures.

Each employer ensures that their employees understand and comply with all the procedures, restrictions and prohibitions in their energy control programs.

Use the procedures in the energy control program during shift or personnel changes to ensure the continuity of lockout or tagout protection.

Please consult your employer's energy control program for procedures for group lockout/tagout. These may include:

- Identifying a person responsible for group lockout/tagout

- Describing personal lockout or tagout device and processes

- Using a group lockbox or lockout device
