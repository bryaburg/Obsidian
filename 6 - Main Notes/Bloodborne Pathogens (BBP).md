# Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP)

True

- Hepatitis symptoms may look like the flu
- People can transmit HIV even if they don’t show symptoms
- There is a vaccine for hepatitis B

False

- HIV symptoms begin to appear immediately after exposure
- There is a cure for hepatitis B 
- There is a vaccine for HIV

BBPs are transmitted through contact with infected blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM), such as vaginal secretions or semen.

Three routes of workplace exposure include:

- Puncture wounds
- Open cuts and skin abrasions
- Eyes, nose and mouth

Matt uses the same hammer as someone who has HIV.

- Exposure to a BBP is unlikely

Rob shakes hands with someone who has hepatitis B.

- Exposure to a BBP is unlikely

Rosa uses her bare hands to bandage a skinned elbow for a co-worker with hepatitis C.

- Exposure to a BBP is likely

What is the one thing you should always assume about blood or OPIM?

- All blood and OPIM are contaminated with BBPs

Properly cover open cuts and skin abrasions.

Never do the following in potential exposure areas:

- Eat

- Apply cosmetics or lip balm

Wash your hands and exposed skin with soap and running water:

- Immediately after an exposure incident

- After removing gloves or other PPE

- As soon as possible after an alternative hand-washing method, such as using hand sanitizer or towelettes

Engineering controls isolate or remove BBP hazards from the workplace and are the best ways to reduce your risk of exposure to blood and OPIM.

Examples include:

- Sharps disposal containers

- Biohazard bags and containers

- Self-sheathing needles

- Biological safety cabinets


Keep the following in mind when handling blood or OPIM:

- Wear gloves when handling blood or OPIM

- Wear eye protection if there’s any chance of splash

- Check PPE for tears, holes or punctures

- Ensure PPE is clean and fits properly

- Remove PPE properly to avoid self-contamination

- Place used PPE in the proper containers

Wearing gloves does NOT remove the risk of exposure, just minimizes it!

Watch where you put your gloved hands and make sure all contamination is cleaned and disinfected later.

While you wear gloves, don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Remove gloves properly to avoid self-contamination.

If you see blood or OPIM, don appropriate PPE and then clean them up immediately.

Your employer may provide a spill kit or offer more specific guidelines regarding how to clean up blood or OPIM, but here are some general rules to follow.  

To clean up blood or OPIM:

1. Carefully cover surface spills with paper towels.

2. Gently pour a 10% (or 1-to-10) bleach to water solution over towels/equipment.

3. Allow the bleach solution to remain in place for at least 10 minutes.

4. Disinfect or properly discard any cleanup supplies.

Note: Use autoclaves in medical environments to sterilize equipment and treat infectious waste.

When you clean up and throw away blood, OPIM, medical waste or sharp objects, you’ve got to plan ahead.

Plan for and follow these disposal guidelines:

- Place sharp objects in sharps containers

- Dispose of blood, OPIM and medical waste in infectious waste or biohazard containers

- Never recap needles unless you have to

- Use a disposal dustpan and broom, tongs or forceps to clean up broken glass or pieces of metal

Remember to decontaminate any areas or equipment exposed to blood or OPIM using a 10% bleach solution for at least 10 minutes.

- First, inspect and then wear gloves. 
- Cover the blood with paper towels and soak them with 10% bleach solution for 10 minutes. 
- Dispose of the paper towels and used gloves in a biohazard container and then wash your hands thoroughly. 

If you may have been exposed to a BBP, immediately:

- Clean wounds with soap and water

- Flush eyes and mucous membranes with water or saline solution for 15 minutes

- Alert and work with your supervisor and any other appropriate personnel

- Complete applicable exposure incident reports

You may also receive:

- Education and access to any additional disease-preventing measures

- Hepatitis B vaccine or booster

- HIV post-exposure treatment

- Blood tests

- Counseling

All treatment provided by your employer should be confidential and protected.
