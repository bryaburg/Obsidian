# Fall Protection

- Ladders

- Mobile elevated work platforms such as scissor lifts and aerial lifts

These are just a few of the many fall hazards that you may face every day at work, and you are responsible for determining if you are properly protected from falling.

- Use fall protection anytime you are working on an unprotected or elevated work surface from which you could fall

- Fall protection is generally required when working

- 4 feet above the ground (general industry)

- 6 feet above the ground (construction)

- If you are unsure about using fall protection on your worksite, ask your manager or supervisor for guidance as they will be knowledgeable about any site-specific rules in place

- Passive systems:

- Guardrails, covers, safety nets

- Active systems:

- Work positioning, fall restraint, fall arrest

- “Tie or Die” describes fall protection

- Guardrails may be made from a variety of materials

- Make sure guardrails are properly installed and all rails are solid and not loose

- Report loose or damaged guardrails to your supervisor

- The top rail needs to be 42 inches above the work surface

- The mid-rail needs to be halfway between the working surface and the top rail

- Guardrails needs to be able to support 200 pounds of force  

Floor and roof hole covers must be:

- Able to support 2 times the potential load

- Secured

- Marked “hole” or “cover”

If hole covers are located on working surfaces where lifts or other equipment are being used, heavy-duty material is needed so tires don’t break through. You must steer clear of hole covers.

Secondary fall protection is a backup to primary fall protection. It is in place to catch you or prevent you from falling when your primary system fails.

Personal fall protection must be used when:

- Guardrails are removed

- Guardrails/covers are not able to be installed

- Climbing ladders equipped with safety systems

- You are working hands-free

Even when used properly, a fall stopped by personal fall protection can still injure you.

When planning to use personal fall protection, consider:

- Free fall

- Clearance

- Swing fall

See your supervisor for site-specific information such as:

- Plans for rescue assistance should falls occur

- Potential availability of mobile elevated work platforms with guardrail protection

Free fall is the distance traveled from the point where you start falling to the point where your fall protection system begins to slow you down.

- Keep below 6 feet

- Make sure your lanyard snaphook is at D-ring level or higher

- Clearance distance is the distance required for your personal fall arrest equipment to activate, decelerate and then completely stop your fall

- Clearance can change due to obstructions that move into the area below

- Trucks or lifts

- Material storage

- Clearance must be calculated in all areas where you might work

- This is especially important if you are using a fall protection system that allows your anchor point to move with you

If you are using a standard, 6-foot energy-absorbing lanyard, you will need:

6 feet (length of lanyard)

+ 3½ feet (deceleration and harness movement)

+ 6 feet (height of worker)

+ 3 feet (safety factor)

= 18½ feet  
total clearance

Check with your supervisor to determine if you have enough clearance for the system you are using.

- If you fall after walking away from under your anchor point, you will swing back to under the anchor point

- The result could be your body striking an object or your lanyard being cut on a sharp edge

- In severe cases, the distance of your swing fall could cause you to hit the ground

Clearance must be calculated in all areas where you might work, and it can change due to obstructions that move into the area below.

- Personal fall protection includes:

- Work positioning

- Allows you to work hands-free

- Fall restraint

- Prevents you from falling off an edge or into an opening

- Fall arrest

- Catches your body after you have fallen

- Does not prevent a fall, but minimizes the damage an unprotected fall can have on your body

- Use the best method to do your work

- Remember that these are active systems and only work when they are properly installed 

- Positioning systems are primarily used for work at height where hands-free operations are required, but excessive movement is not necessary

- No more than a 2-foot free fall is allowable

- Use along with a secondary fall arrest system

- Fall restraint systems prevent you from reaching a fall hazard

- They must be installed so that your waist cannot move over the working edge

- When using a fall restraint system, make sure exposure to a fall has been eliminated 360 degrees around you

- With fall arrest, you must consider:

- Free fall

- Clearance

- Swing fall

- Fall arrest is the last resort for fall protection

- It must be used properly to minimize your risk of injury or death

In the case of a standard 6-foot energy-absorbing lanyard, you add the length of the lanyard plus 3.5 feet for the deceleration distance, 6 feet on average for your height, and a safety factor distance of 3 feet, which totals 18½ feet.

Fall restraint prevents a worker from falling by limiting the amount of travel distance. When rigged properly, fall restraint will not allow any part of the body to move over an edge where a fall could take place.

Each fall protection system is composed of:

- Body support

- Connectors

- Anchorage

- Self-Retracting Lifeline (SRL) or shock-absorbing lanyard

A full body harness:

- Holds the body in a fall

- Must fit properly

- Must be inspected

- Prior to use

- If welding or working in areas where chemicals or sharp edges are present, more frequent inspection is required

- Chest strap must be positioned so that it holds the shoulder straps in place and prevents slipping

- Leg straps must be snug

- Back D-ring must be positioned between the shoulder blades

- Sub-pelvic straps must not be twisted and must be located snugly below the buttock

Types of connectors include:

- Lanyards

- Snaphooks

- Carabiners

The back D-ring of a full body harness must be centered between the shoulder blades.

- Factors that determine fall force include:

- Weight of the worker

- Free fall distance

- Deceleration distance

- When an energy-absorbing lanyard is used, the deceleration distance is increased and the impact force is reduced

- The body’s injury threshold is 2,700 pounds

- Impact forces must remain below 1,800 pounds for workers

- Energy- or shock-absorbing lanyards have an additional 3½ feet of material that tears out or stretches

- 6-foot lanyard + 3½ feet of shock-absorbing material = 9½ feet

- Double leg lanyards are used when you must unhook one lanyard to move around an obstruction

- Second lanyard is hooked up before you unhook the first, which allows for 100% tie-off

- Choose the right lanyard for the job

- Lanyards are attached to the back D-ring of your full body harness

- When attaching a shock-absorbing lanyard to the D-ring of your harness, the shock absorber is placed closest to the D-ring

- Read the instructions to make sure

In fact, when used correctly, an energy-absorbing lanyard will limit fall forces to 900 pounds.

- Finding a good anchor point is important because it must hold all the forces you generate when you fall

- Anchor points must be capable of withstanding a 5,000-pound load (e.g., a pickup truck!)

- Bigger is better

- Higher is better

- Don’t attach fall protection equipment to guardrails

- Anchor points need a qualified person’s approval

- Check your anchor point for stability

How could this worker’s protection be improved?

- The ladder needs to be taller for more stability

- A shock-absorbing lanyard would provide more protection

- The anchorage connection location creates a severe free fall hazard

- It would be better to locate the anchorage connection here

Select anchorage connectors that are safe and compatible with your fall arrest system.

- Tie-off adapters

- Beam clamps

- Fixed

- Gliding

- Weld-on, bolt-on D-rings

Self-Retracting Lifelines:

- Require much less clearance than a lanyard

- Clearance needed is just 4½ feet

- Are designed to allow you more freedom of movement than a lanyard

- Lock up to stop fall

You must:

- Locate the unit above your head whenever possible

- Attach it directly to back D-ring of your full body harness

- Never attach a lanyard to the unit

- Inspect it before using

Vertical lifelines:

- Are commonly used on suspended scaffolds or when climbing ladders or scaffolds

- Are typically constructed of rope that is designed to be used for fall arrest

- Require extra clearance due to stretch

Each worker who uses a vertical lifeline will use a rope grab device.

- The rope grab (manual or automatic) bites into the rope and will stop the fall

- Use a lanyard no longer than 3 feet if using an automatic rope grab

- Keep the rope grab as high as possible to minimize free fall

Horizontal lifelines:

- Are installed under the supervision of a qualified person

- Usually consist of special stanchions, wire rope and energy-absorbing components

- Require that you maintain 100% connection

- It may be necessary to use a double leg lanyard so you can remain tied off when moving around stanchions

Never attempt to tighten, remove, install or modify a horizontal lifeline unless instructed by your supervisor.

An anchor point must be able to hold 5,000 pounds.

Self-Retracting Lifelines give you more freedom of movement than a lanyard.

Personal fall protection must be inspected:

- Prior to use

- At least annually by a competent person

If any equipment is ever involved in a fall, even if it does not show signs of damage, remove it from use, return it to your supervisor and retrieve another fall protection device. The competent person will determine if equipment can be safely returned to service.

The two categories of fall protection are:

- Software

- Nylon, polyester

- Hardware

- Metal

Inspect your full body harness and lanyard prior to use.

Lanyards, harnesses, synthetic slings and ropes must be inspected for:

- Cut/torn fibers and threads

- Missing, illegible labels

- Burns or chemical damage

If you notice signs that a lanyard or other fall arrest equipment has been deployed, take it out of service immediately.

Snaphooks, carabiners, rope grabs, cables, and metal integral to software must be inspected for:

- Corrosion, cracks, deformation, burrs, wear spots

- Dirt, paint, grease

- Missing nuts, bolts, cotter pins

- Gate operation (should close easily)

Remove and return to your supervisor if damaged.

Store equipment properly.

- Never throw it into a storage box

- Hang it up

- Keep it dry and clean

- Keep it out of direct sunlight

Rescue must be simple and safe, using:

- Ladders

- Lifts

- Engineered rescue systems that meet ANSI standards

The hierarchy of rescue after a fall is:

- Self-rescue

- Climb or pull yourself to safety

- Assisted self-rescue

- Suspension trauma safety straps

- Ladders

- Mechanically aided rescue

- Lifts

- Rescue pick-off (in very rare situations)

OSHA’s medical aid guidelines require an injured worker to receive medical care within 4 to 15 minutes after the incident occurs. Since a fallen worker suffers from suspension trauma, it’s important that help arrive quickly. The ANSI Z359 fall protection standard calls for starting rescue efforts within 6 minutes.

If someone has fallen and can't climb to safety, the next step is to assist by providing a ladder.

Impact forces must remain below 1,800 pounds, which is provided by an energy-absorbing lanyard.

Fall protection equipment should be hung up in a dry, clean place when stored.

Guardrails must be able to support 200 pounds of force.
