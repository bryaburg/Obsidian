2) FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
O&O RegEditor comes in two flavors:

  + OOREGEDT.EXE - Native 64bit version of O&O RegEditor
  + OOREGEDT32.EXE - Native 32bit version of O&O RegEditor
  
Please note that you can run both version on a 64bit Windows, but only
the 32bit version on a Windows 32bit.

Additionally, the following files are required:

  + en\OOREGEDT.DLL - English resources  
  + de\OOREGEDT.DLL - German resources  

During the start, O&O RegEditor will determine your system locale and
load the appropriate language resources accordingly. If you like to force
the start in a particular language, just rename or delete the unwanted
language files.

While O&O RegEditor is bein used, it will create a OOREGEDT.INI file. This
file contains all information about your settings and will keep a history
of your recently used keys. You can, however, delete this file at any time
and it will be recreated the next time you use the program. This file is 
shared by both 32bit and 64bit versions.

3) FREEWARE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

O&O RegEditor is FREEWARE! So no one (and we mean no one!) may charge you for
using it. If you were charged, please get a refund or contact us to help you.

If O&O RegEditor came with an installation, this might have been a wrapper
that wanted to install possibly unwanted programs (aka PUP). Please report
the source of your download to us and we will take appropriate actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) PORTABLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

O&O RegEditor is completely portable. It requires no installation and you can
start it from any location (e.g. local or thumb drive) as described above.
