</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  All of the conditions were set for   fluid to be flowing and a zero   flow rate was measured. This may   be due to no fluid pressure or pilot         air pressure. With a very low flow         rate the gain may be too high. One of   the following items may be broken:   Color Valve, Color select board,   gun trigger, flow meter, flow meter          pickup, Accuflow interface board, or         the 32 point input module.      Note, Accuflow automatically changes   to Open Loop when this failure occurs.    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> If fluid can be seen coming from the   applicator, check: flow meter, flow   meter pickup, Accuflow interface    and the 32 point input module. Other-   wise check the other items listed above.   If it occurs with very low flow rates   decrease the Gain modifier.    </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  As Accuflow steps down through the 10         points in the calibration table, it         expects a lower flow for each decrease         in the commanded flow value.  In this         case, the flow did not decrease. This   can be caused by low or pulsing fluid   pressure, insufficent exhaust or no         quick exhaust on the fluid pilot air.    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Retry the calibration. Check that an         adequate and stable flow rate is         provided by the system for this color.         Decreasing the leveling trys may help.         Check that fluid pilot regulator air         line has adequate exhaust capability.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  As a particular flow rate set point is          being output, the yield ((cc/min)/cnt)         for that flow rate was larger than          the tolerance band for it.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  The relationship of the output command to the flow  rate obtained has changed significantly since the last  calibration.  There is now a larger output  required to get the same flow rate.  This can be caused by: a clogged air cap, clogged gun, pinched air lines or large losses of air supply pressure. Note that the system continues to close the loop and  generally maintain requested flow rates even after this  alarm if there are no other alarms occurring. This alarm can provide early warning of the possible failures. This alarm is controlled by the Adaptive tolerance parameter. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Check, clean and possibly replace the air cap. Check for a large loss of air supply pressure.  Check for pinched air lines or clogged air passages in the gun.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  The relationship of the output command to the flow  rate obtained has changed significantly since the last  calibration.

<h3 class="title"><a name="PNT1-665"></a>PNT1-665 %sDyn. yield &gt; min tolerance band</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  As a particular flow rate set point is being output the yield (slpm/cnt) for that flow rate was  approximately larger than the percent tolerance.  It is not likely that the set point will be reached within the specified tolerances.  This may be caused by the use  of a flow rate setpoint that is below the value that the  air system can accurately provide. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  In some way decrease the yield.  Use larger  diameter air lines to supply air to the cap.  Use a smaller ratio booster.  Otherwise accept a larger tolerance band. Increase the minimum tolerance (by about 50%). </p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="PNT1-666"></a>PNT1-666 %sCal. table adapted out, down</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  The relationship of the output command to the flow  rate obtained has changed significantly since the last  calibration.  There is now a smaller output  required to get the same flow rate.  This can be caused by: air leaks, a loose air cap or a significant increase of air supply pressure Note that the system continues to close the loop and  generally maintain requested flow rates even after this  alarm if there are no other alarms occurring. This alarm can provide early warning of the possible failures. This alarm is controlled by the Adaptive tolerance parameter. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Check that the air cap is tight on the gun. Check, clean and possibly replace the air cap. Check for leaks in air lines or at fittings. Check for cracks or breaks in the gun. Check for a large increase of air supply pressure.  Recalibrate to immediately clear the alarm. Increase the Adaptive tolerance parameter to allow larger changes without alarming </p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="PNT1-667"></a>PNT1-667 %sMax. flow is below midpt. output</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  During calibration it was found that the maximum amount of flow occurred with the command output at only the middle (midpoint) of the range.  This indicates that there is wrong equipment installed or the equipment is faulty. This may also indicate a large air leak. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Check that the I/P transducer is the right range, if not replace it.  Check that the booster has the correct ratio, typcially 1 to 1. If the alarm log also has a leak alarm follow the remedies for that alarm If this equipment must be used reduce the Max. control value for this parameter by about 20%. </p>

With the air lines  all reconnected and air pressure on, if the display on the air flow meter reads more flow than  the Fast leak flow parameter then follow the cause & remedy for the Fast air flow leak detected alarm. </p>

The inlet regulator has failed. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Make sure the high pressure warning limit is appropriate. Make sure the high pressure sensitivity is appropriate. Make sure the supply pressure is appropriate. Check the hardener inlet transducer as follows:   Through the Analog I/O menu verify the transducer is   spanning from near 200 cnts (0 psi) to 600+ cnts (50-80 psi)   during a color change cycle. Check the resin inlet regulator as follows:   Through the Analog I/O menu verify the command 200-1000 cnts   (0-100 psi) spanning by verifying the output psi at the   transducer test port. </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br> The PGOT procedure was not                 performed on the processes used            within the selected job (style).           The TPR is equal to zero.

<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Perform the PGOT procedure on            the desired job (style).  Test             cycle job or allow it correct              itself by running the process in           production, if enough paint has            been loaded into the canister.      </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br> The previous job gun on time for           the current job differs from the           calculated preset gun on times             used for the TPR calculation by            more than the allowed tolerance.           The Gun On Time stored in the job          header does not correspond to the          preset on times read from the job          processes.  This can be a result           of process changes done on the             fly.  The robot will not have the          proper amount of paint to run the          job.                                </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Perform a PGOT test cycle on the         job that caused the TPR mismatch           alarm.  If the robot has filled            sufficiently for the job, then it          will automatically correct the             TPR when the job is completed.             If the robot has faulted due to            this alarm, then reset and                 continue the job.  If this alarm           commonly occurs due to on the fly          process changes, then increase             the Gun On Time Error Tolerance.           Caution must be used in setting            this value too high, because if            the new gun on time is                     sufficiently higher than the old           gun on time in the header, the             TPR will be too low and the gun            will run out of paint.              </p>

<h3 class="title"><a name="PNT2-164"></a>PNT2-164 %sTPR exceeds Can Volume</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br> The Total Paint Required (TPR) as          calculated from the Preset Gun On          Time (PGOT) in the TP programs             exceeds the volume of the canister.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br> The previous job gun on time for           the current job differs from the           calculated preset gun on times             used for the TPR calculation by            more than the allowed tolerance.           The Gun On Time stored in the job          header does not correspond to the          preset on times read from the job          processes.  This can be a result           of process changes done on the             fly.

<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Perform a PGOT test cycle on the         job that caused the TPR mismatch           alarm.  If the robot has filled            sufficiently for the job, then it          will automatically correct the             TPR when the job is completed.             If the robot has faulted due to            this alarm, then reset and                 continue the job.  If this alarm           commonly occurs due to on the fly          process changes, then increase             the Gun On Time Error Tolerance.           Caution must be used in setting            this value too high, because if            the new gun on time is                     sufficiently higher than the old           gun on time in the header, the             TPR will be too low and the gun            will run out of paint.              </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  All of the conditions were set for   fluid to be flowing and a zero   flow rate was measured. This may   be due to no fluid pressure or pilot         air pressure. With a very low flow         rate the gain may be too high. One of   the following items may be broken:   Color Valve, Color select board,   gun trigger, flow meter, flow meter          pickup, Accuflow interface board, or         the 32 point input module.      Note, Accuflow automatically changes   to Open Loop when this failure occurs.    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> If fluid can be seen coming from the   applicator, check: flow meter, flow   meter pickup, Accuflow interface    and the 32 point input module. Other-   wise check the other items listed above.   If it occurs with very low flow rates   decrease the Gain modifier.    </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  As Accuflow steps down through the 10         points in the calibration table, it         expects a lower flow for each decrease         in the commanded flow value.  In this         case, the flow did not decrease. This   can be caused by low or pulsing fluid   pressure, insufficent exhaust or no         quick exhaust on the fluid pilot air.    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Retry the calibration. Check that an         adequate and stable flow rate is         provided by the system for this color.         Decreasing the leveling trys may help.         Check that fluid pilot regulator air         line has adequate exhaust capability.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  This may be caused by pulsing paint         pressure or a broken I/P transducer.

If this occurs on specific         colors, check the surge suppression system         fluid supply system.

</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>     All of the conditions were set for fluid to  be flowing and a zero flow rate was measured for longer than the Zero flow timeout parameter.  This may be caused by: a broken applicator trigger,  a loss of fluid supply pressure,  a broken fluid flow meter, a broken cable (to the flow  meter), or a Zero flow timeout value that is too short.  Note, AccuFlow temporarily automatically changes to Open  Loop when this alarm occurs. </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  This alarm occurs only during calibration. The flowrate measured at the maximum control and one half of the maximum control output was nearly the same.   Less than one half of the control output  range is useable.  The system may still function even though this alarm has occurred.  This may be caused by low fluid pressure, a faulty transducer or regulator or the wrong I/P transducer being installed (100 psi range instead of 50 psi range). </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Increase the fluid pressure.  Check that the transducer is functioning properly and that it is has the correct pressure range, change it if appropriate. The system may operate, but performance can be improved with one of the above remedies.   </p>

The I/P transducer or fluid regulator   may be stuck open.   There may be a fairly large fluid leak.      Note, Accuflow automatically changes   to Open Loop when this failure occurs.    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Calibrating the color will establish a   new cracking pressure (minimum control   output) for a changed fluid pressure.   Check and replace if necessary the   fluid regulator and I/P transducer.   See the Fluid flow leak alarms for    other options.    </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  This may be caused by pulsing paint         pressure or a broken I/P transducer.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>     All of the conditions were set for fluid to  be flowing and a zero flow rate was measured for longer than the Zero flow timeout parameter.  This may be caused by: a broken applicator trigger,  a loss of fluid supply pressure,  a broken fluid flow meter, a broken cable (to the flow  meter), or a Zero flow timeout value that is too short.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  This alarm occurs only during calibration. The flowrate measured at the maximum control and one half of the maximum control output was nearly the same.   Less than one half of the control output  range is useable.  The system may still function even though this alarm has occurred.  This may be caused by low fluid pressure, a faulty transducer or regulator or the wrong I/P transducer being installed (100 psi range instead of 50 psi range). </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Increase the fluid pressure.  Check that the transducer is functioning properly and that it is has the correct pressure range, change it if appropriate. The system may operate, but performance can be improved with one of the above remedies.   </p>

</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  As a particular flow rate set point is          being output, the yield ((cc/min)/cnt)         for that flow rate was larger than          the tolerance band for it.  It is          not likely that the set point will         be reached.  This may be due to the         restricters in the gun being too large.    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> In some way decrease the yield.  Use         smaller restricters in the gun if the         high end flow rate can still obtained.         Otherwise accept a larger tolerance band.

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  The relationship of the output command to the flow  rate obtained has changed significantly since the last  calibration.

In this case the flow did not decrease.  This can be  caused by insufficient exhaust, no quick exhaust on the  pilot air line, too large of a hysteresis in control  equipment, or the system response is too slow for the  current setting of the Calibration step delay  parameter. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Retry the calibration.  Check that the pilot  air line to the booster has sufficient exhaust capability. Increase the Calibration step delay parameter (by about  100%).   Reducing the Leveling tries parameter may help. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  The relationship of the output command to the flow  rate obtained has changed significantly since the last  calibration.  There is now a larger output  required to get the same flow rate.  This can be caused by: a clogged air cap, clogged gun, pinched air lines or large losses of air supply pressure. Note that the system continues to close the loop and  generally maintain requested flow rates even after this  alarm if there are no other alarms occurring. This alarm can provide early warning of the possible failures. This alarm is controlled by the Adaptive tolerance parameter. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Check, clean and possibly replace the air cap. Check for a large loss of air supply pressure.  Check for pinched air lines or clogged air passages in the gun. Recalibrate to immediately clear the alarm. Increase the Adaptive tolerance parameter to allow larger changes without alarming </p>

</div>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  As a particular flow rate set point is being output the yield (slpm/cnt) for that flow rate was  approximately larger than the percent tolerance.  It is not likely that the set point will be reached within the specified tolerances.  This may be caused by the use  of a flow rate setpoint that is above the value that the  air system can provide. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  In some way decrease the yield.  Use larger  diameter air lines to supply air to the cap.  Use a larger ratio booster (2:1 instead of 1:1) booster (if the system can not supply the high flow rates provided).  Use a smaller ratio booster.  Otherwise accept a larger tolerance band. Increase the Percent tolerance band (by about 50%). </p>

Possible causes are: clogged air  cap, sticking I/P transducer, bad air booster or pinching  air lines. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Check, clean and possibly replace the air cap. Check for oscillating air pressure on the output of the I/P  transducer.  If found replace the transducer.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>     All of the conditions were set for air to  be flowing and a zero flow rate was measured.  This may be caused by: a broken applicator trigger, pinched air lines, a loss (or near loss) of air supply pressure,  a broken air flow sensor, a broken cable (to the flow  sensor), or a Trigger delay that is too short. Note, AccuAir temporarily automatically changes to Open  Loop when this alarm occurs. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Check, clean and possibly replace the air cap. Check that the gun is properly triggering.  If air was  observed to be flowing check and possibly replace the  air flow sensor.  Check for a pinched air line.  Increase the Trigger delay parameter (by about 50%). </p>

</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>    As the AccuAir calibration steps down through  the 10 points in the calibration table, it expects a  lower flow for each decrease in the command flow value. In this case the flow did not decrease.  This can be  caused by insufficient exhaust, no quick exhaust on the  pilot air line, too large of a hysteresis in control  equipment, or the system response is too slow for the  current setting of the Calibration step delay  parameter. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Retry the calibration.  Check that the pilot  air line to the booster has sufficient exhaust capability. Increase the Calibration step delay parameter (by about  100%).   Reducing the Leveling tries parameter may help. </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  With a minimum control output the flow rate was  measured to be higher than the setpoint (requested flow).

</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  The IPC auto calibration aborted because zero PSI was detected while the IPC system was determining the maximum flow rate during the auto calibration or while the IPC system was determining one of the calibration points. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Ensure pumps are operating correctly. Ensure that the speed command delay (used to allow the motor RPM to settle) is set to a sufficient amount. If the setup parameter, &apos;Max speed cap:&apos;, was enabled, ensure that the parameter &apos;User speed cap:&apos;, was not set to high - the pressure will eventually plateau at higher speed commands. Alternate action is to disable &apos;Max speed cap:&apos; and re-calibrate. </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br> The piston was retracted from the fluid after the    Fill sequence and torque was still detected on the face of  the piston.  The torque should not exist if the canister    is completely full of paint, therefore, compressed air      could me mixed with the paint.                              </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Check the paint supply for the current color in     the canister to verify air in not being introduced into     paint supply.                                               </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br>  Excessive current is drawn from the HV system. IMAX fault can be caused by the applicator being too close to a grounded component. It can also be caused by too much current leaking into the paint delivery system. Excessive overspray accumulation can also be the cause of an IMAX fault. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br>  Inspect target distance and correct. Move robot away from grounded components and try to isolate excessive current path. Is the fault produced with a specific paint type? Unplug the HV cable and confirm problem is isolated to robot application system. If the problem still occurs with the HV cable removed/unplugged from the HV controller then it is likely a bad HV controller. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br> Indicates that an error has been detected in communication  between the MAIN CPU PCB and the process I/O board, Model-A I/O racks, or Model-B I/O interface units.  The most common causes of this are the following:   o Power to a remote I/O rack or Model-B I/O interface unit      is interrupted.   o The cable between the MAIN CPU PCB and the process I/O board,       racks, or Model-B interface units has been disconnected or is      faulty.   o Electrical interference between the I/O cables and other cables.      This can be eliminated by physically separating the I/O cables      from other wiring.  In very electrically noisy environments, it      might be necessary to use optical isolators with these cables. </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Check the cabling between theMAIN CPU PCB (JB-18 connector) and the process I/O board and/or model A or B interface modules. Check power to the remote Model A I/O racks and model B I/O interface modules.  If corrections to these do not correct the problem, check the four numbers displayed in this error message. The first value must be interpreted bit-wise.  If a bit is 1, the corresponding condition has been detected:     Bit 0: (CFER) A CRC or framing error has been detected by the             SLC-2 chip on the MAIN CPU PBC.  This is most frequently             the result of the problems listed above.  Otherwise, it might            indicate faulty SLC-2 chip, wiring between this and             the JB-1B connector on the main PCB, or faulty process            I/O, model-A I/O rack, or model-B interface unit.     Bit 1: (CALM) An error has been detected by a slave SLC-2 (process            I/O board, Model-A rack, or Model B interface unit).            More information is  provided by the second number displayed            with the PRIO-020 error.     Bit 2: (CMER) A communication error has been detected by a slave            SLC-2.  The potential causes are similar to those for             a CFER.     Bit 3: (IPRER): Internal parity error accessing SLC-2 internal            RAM.  This indicates a faulty SLC-2 chip.  In this case,             the third and fourth numbers displayed with the PRIO-020             error is the address and  and data for which the error was             detected.  This indicates a faulty SLC-2 chip.     Bit 4: (OPRER): Parity error accessing external RAM by the SLC-2            chip.  This might indicate bad DRAM or CMOS memory on the            MAIN CPU PCB.     Bit 5: (ALMI): Indicates an alarm signalled from outside the SLC-2.            Check the controller Alarm Log for other errors reported.     Bit 6: (BSY):  Auto scan is running.  This might be either 0 or 1 and            does not indicate an error.     Bit 7: (CEND): Auto-scan cycle has completed.  This might be either             0 or 1 and does not indicate an error.  The second number displayed is significant only if the CMER bit above is one.     Bits 0-4:  Indicate the position in the I/O Link chain of the            slave unit in which error was detected.  A value of 1            indicates the unit connected directly             to the I/O LINK connector.     Bit 5 (CFER): Indicates a CRC or framing error detected by the            slave SLC-2.  The causes are similar to those for a CFER            error detected by the MAIN CPU SLC-2.     Bit 6 (ALMI): Indicates an error asserted outside the slave SLC-2.           This may indicate a problem with process I/O board, model-B           I/O rack, or model-B interface unit hardware.     Bit 7 (SYALM):  Indicates a watchdog alarm or parity error detected           by the slave SLC-2.  This may indicate a problem with the            process I/O board, model-A rack, or model-B interface           unit.  The third number displays which CPU is related to an error.     1,2:  PMC CPU     3,4:  MAIN CPU  The fourth number displays alarm status by new function. The detecting way is new, but detectable error is as usual. (RETRYAL&lt;-CFER, CMERAL&lt;-CMER, CENDAL&lt;-CEND)      Bits 0-3:  Indicate the position in the I/O Link chain of the            slave unit in which error was detected. A value of 0            indicates the unit connected directly             to the I/O LINK connector.     Bit 4 (RETRYAL):Indicates a CRC or framing error detected.     Bit 5 (SLVAL)  :Indicates an alarm occurs in a slave device.     Bit 6 (CMERAL) :A communication error has been detected.     Bit 7 (CENDAL) :CEND error has been detected. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Cause:</b><br> Error is found in I/O Device configuration     from partner, the I/O Controller that tries    to connect the robot. For example, the module  of slot number 0 is present, which is not      permissible when V2.6 firmware is used. This   kind of error is caused probably because       wrong GSD file is used when the partner is     configured.                                    </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Check the manual to see which GSD file should  be used according to the software version of   the robot controller and the firmware version  of the firmware on PROFINET board. Install     the proper GSD file to the configuration tool  if needed. Correct the configuration of the    partner. For example, replace robot I/O        device by that from proper GSD file, compile   the project and download it to the partner.    </p>

<p><b>Cause:</b><br> XDB backup file in the specified device path   doesn&apos;t match the configuration on PROFINET    board.                                         </p>
<p><b>Remedy:</b><br> Check if configuration is on PROFINET board.   If there is no configuration, downloading XDB  might be required. If there is configuration,  the XDB backup file in the specified device    path migth be old. It is up to the operator to download XDB backup file to PROFINET board, or to update XDB backup file.                     </p>
